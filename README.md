# image uploader
This code was created base on Tutorial for my students on how to upload image to MongoDB with NodeJS and Express for the backend and ReactJS in frontend, Feel free to copy it if you want to use it


## Image Uploader consist of two section

### Frontend
### Backend

To run this on you computer after cloned it, go to the frontend folder and run: <code>npm install</code>, it will install all the dependencies need for the app to run
then go to the backend folder also and run: <code>npm install</code> and don't forget to change the mongoDb url to yours.

then at make sure you're at the <code>frontend</code> path on the terminal then run <code>npm start</code> and also goto <code>backend</code> path on your terminal and run <code>node index</code>

after they start running the goto your browser and insert the <code>localhost:3000</code> to see the output of the app.

## Happy coding
